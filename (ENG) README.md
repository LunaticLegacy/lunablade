# La Luna Mathematic
中文版本：[这里](README.md)

## What is La Luna Mathematic?
La Luna Mathematic is a personally hosted, unofficial modeling competition.

No prizes, no certificates, no rankings — and frankly, your real name doesn’t even matter.

But one thing is certain: **Your modeling report will be read carefully**.

This is a hobby-driven, passion-fueled competition.
After all, nothing teaches you more about modeling than becoming the one who writes the problem.

You can join anonymously, form a team online, or just go solo. No rules, no pressure.

## How often is a problem released?
**Totally random.** A new problem drops whenever inspiration strikes.

Each problem comes with **both Chinese and English versions**, so you’ll at least understand what it’s asking.

As for whether you can solve it... good luck.

## What kind of problems are they?
**Also random.。** 

Sometimes it's optimization, sometimes it's probability, and sometimes...
well, you might wonder if the question was designed just to mess with you.

## How difficult are they?
**Random.**

Whatever strange idea pops up, that’s the difficulty you get.

## Are there prizes or awards?
**Nope.** 

You join this competition simply because you want to.

## So why should I even bother joining?
- Want to try a completely mind-bending modeling challenge? ✅
- Want a reason to stay up all night hacking code with your friends? ✅
- Want to finally use every skill you know without being told “that’s off-topic”? ✅
- Want someone to actually read your report with care? ✅✅✅

## Will all reports be reviewed seriously?
Yes. But it’s currently a one-person committee (a.k.a. just me), so it might take a while.

## Any submission requirements?
Yes - just submit something meaningful. As long as your report shows thought and effort, it counts.
