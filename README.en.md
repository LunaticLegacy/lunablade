## What is *Luna Mathematica*?

Luna Mathematica is a **personally hosted, unofficial modeling competition**.

No prizes, no certificates, no rankings — and honestly, your real name doesn’t even matter.

But one thing is certain: **your modeling report will be read carefully.**

This is a hobby-driven, passion-powered event.  
After all, nothing teaches you more about modeling than becoming the one who writes the problem.

You can join anonymously, form a team online, or go solo. No rules, no pressure.

## How often is a problem released?

**Totally random.**  
A new problem drops whenever inspiration strikes.

Each one comes with **both Chinese and English versions**, so at least you'll understand what it’s asking.  
As for solving it... good luck.

## What kind of problems are they?

**Also random.**  

Sometimes it’s optimization. Sometimes it’s probability.  
And sometimes... you might seriously wonder if the whole thing is a joke.

## How difficult are they?

**Unpredictable.**  
Whatever strange idea pops into my head, that’s the difficulty you get.

## Are there prizes or awards?

**Nope.**  
You participate because you *want to*, not because there’s something to win.

## So why bother joining?

- Looking for a mind-bending modeling challenge? ✅  
- Want an excuse to pull an all-nighter with your friends? ✅  
- Tired of being told “that’s out of scope”? ✅  
- Hoping someone will actually read your work? ✅✅✅  

## Will all reports be reviewed seriously?

Yes.  
But as of now, it's a one-person review team (a.k.a. just me), so it may take a while.

## Any submission requirements?

Yes — just submit something **meaningful**.  
If your report shows thought and effort, it counts.
